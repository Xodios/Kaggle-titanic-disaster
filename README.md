Hello there :))  
I hope you are doing well  
This is my first Kaggle attempt in a competition (The Kaggle-titanic-disaster) to hopefully begin my journey in kaggle competitions^^  
I just followed a guide on youtube from Aladdin Persson (Good youtuber I would higly recommend! He made everything clear and simple to follow^^)  
Here is the link to his tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUSi5xexT4Q  
The score wasn't that high but it's not to compete (specially in this competition you can just fill the submission_file by hand and get a perfect score)  
Have a beautiful day!  
I like penguins
